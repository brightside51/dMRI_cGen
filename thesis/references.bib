   abstract = {This article introduces a new and general framework for optimizing the experiment design for diffusion MRI of samples with unknown orientation. An illustration then uses the framework to study the feasibility of measuring direct features of brain-tissue microstructure in vivo. The study investigates the accuracy and precision with which we can estimate potentially important new biomarkers such as axon density and radius in white matter. Simulation experiments use a simple model of white matter based on CHARMED (composite hindered and restricted model of diffusion). The optimization finds acquisition protocols achievable on modern human and animal systems that consist of 120 measurements with fixed maximum gradient strengths. Axon radii in brain tissue are typically in the range 0.25-10 μm. Simulations suggest that estimates of radii in the range 5-10 μm have highest precision and that a maximum gradient strength of 0.07 T m-1 is sufficient to distinguish radii of 5, 10, and 20 μm. Smaller radii are more difficult to distinguish from one another but are identifiable as small. A maximum gradient strength of 0.2 T m -1 distinguishes radii of 1 and 2 μm. The simulations also suggest that axon densities and diffusivity parameters in the normal range for white matter are recoverable. The experiment-design optimization has applications well beyond the current work to optimize the protocol for fitting any model of the diffusion process. © 2008 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

@article{dti_basics,
   abstract = {The diffusion of water molecules inside organic tissues is often anisotropic (1). Namely, if there are aligned structures in the tissue, the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) of water may vary depending on the orientation along which the diffusion-weighted (DW) measurements are taken. In the late 1980s, diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) became possible by combining MR diffusion measurements with imaging, enabling the mapping of both diffusion constants and diffusion anisotropy inside the brain and revealing valuable information about axonal architec-tures (2-14). In the beginning of the 1990s, the diffusion tensor model was introduced to describe the degree of an-isotropy and the structural orientation information quantitatively (15,16). This diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) approach provided a simple and elegant way to model this complex neuroanatomical information using only six parameters. Since then, we have witnessed a tremendous amount of growth in this research field, including more sophisticated nontensor models to describe diffusion properties and to extract finer anatomical information from each voxel. Three-dimensional (3D) reconstruction technologies for white matter tracts are also developing beyond the initial deterministic line-propagation models (17-20). As these new reconstruction methods are an area of very active research, it is important to remember that the theory cannot be dissociated from practical aspects of the technology. Importantly, DWI is inherently a noise-sensitive and artifact-prone technique (Fig. 1). Thus, we cannot overemphasize the importance of image quality assurance and robust image analysis techniques. Last but not least, data acquisition technologies have also been steadfastly evolving. In this article, we review the recent advances in these areas since 2000. DATA ACQUISITION TECHNIQUES AND IMAGING PARAMETERS Issues Related to Single-Shot Echo-Planar Imaging and the Potential Solutions DWI is inherently a low-resolution and low-SNR technique. Image quality problems are further exacerbated by its high sensitivity to physiological motion. DWI is sensi-tized to translational motion of water molecules, which is of the order of 5-15 mm assuming typical measurement times. A small amount of subject motion, even cardiac pulsation, can lead to a significant amount of signal phase shift or signal loss, which can severely affect image quality (21-25). To reduce motion sensitivity, single shot echo-planar imaging (EPI) is commonly used. However, these single-shot data acquisitions usually suffer from artifacts and other limitations. The images are distorted due to B 0 susceptibility effects and are prone to eddy current-induced distortions (Figs. 2 and 3). In addition, T* 2 signal decay during the lengthy echo train leads to severe imaging blurring and limits the spatial resolution. To reduce these EPI artifacts, techniques are required to shorten the echo train length and reduce the echo spacing. Parallel imaging and segmented k-space sampling are two widely used such methods. Parallel imaging was introduced in the late 1990s (26) and is ideally suited to DWI, as it allows a substantial shortening of both the echo train length and echo spacing, while retaining the robustness to motion of single-shot EPI. The resulting reduction of B 0-susceptibility artifacts is substantial. With parallel imaging capability now standard on modern magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanners , most DWI studies currently use parallel imaging as part of a routine protocol. However, the acceleration factor (parallel imaging factor) is practically limited to 2-4 depending on the number of receiver channels and coil geometry. If one requires further reduction of susceptibility-induced distortions and/or higher image resolution, a multishot segmented scanning scheme needs to be used. In terms of pulse programming, segmented k-space sampling is straightforward. However, the extreme motion sensitivity of DWI poses a unique challenge. For each shot, translational motion of water leads to signal loss (incoherent motion) or phase shifts (bulk motion). When single-shot imaging is used, phase shifts are irrelevant because the phase information is discarded by the magnitude calculation. However, if the k-space is acquired over multiple shots, phase coherence between shots has to be preserved, which cannot be guaranteed if motion-induced phase shifts occurs. Phase monitoring and post-processing correction are, therefore, imperative to avoid severe artifacts in multishot DWI (27-34). In the past, phase navigation techniques have been used for segmented EPI (35), spiral EPI (36), and FSE type scans. More sophisticated approaches have been proposed including self-navigated blade-type scans such as PROPELLER (37,38), and more recently vertically segmented EPI (39-41). One drawback of all segmented scans is},

@article{utkface_dataset,
   abstract = {"If I provide you a face image of mine (without telling you the actual age when I took the picture) and a large amount of face images that I crawled (containing labeled faces of different ages but not necessarily paired), can you show me what I would look like when I am 80 or what I was like when I was 5?" The answer is probably a "No." Most existing face aging works attempt to learn the transformation between age groups and thus would require the paired samples as well as the labeled query image. In this paper, we look at the problem from a generative modeling perspective such that no paired samples is required. In addition, given an unlabeled image, the generative model can directly produce the image with desired age attribute. We propose a conditional adversarial autoencoder (CAAE) that learns a face manifold, traversing on which smooth age progression and regression can be realized simultaneously. In CAAE, the face is first mapped to a latent vector through a convolutional encoder, and then the vector is projected to the face manifold conditional on age through a deconvolutional generator. The latent vector preserves personalized face features (i.e., personality) and the age condition controls progression vs. regression. Two adversarial networks are imposed on the encoder and generator, respectively, forcing to generate more photo-realistic faces. Experimental results demonstrate the appealing performance and flexibility of the proposed framework by comparing with the state-of-the-art and ground truth.},

@article{image_to_image,
   abstract = {Medical imaging plays a critical role in various clinical applications. However, due to multiple considerations such as cost and radiation dose, the acquisition of certain image modalities may be limited. Thus, medical image synthesis can be of great benefit by estimating a desired imaging modality without incurring an actual scan. In this paper, we propose a generative adversarial approach to address this challenging problem. Specifically, we train a fully convolutional network (FCN) to generate a target image given a source image. To better model a nonlinear mapping from source to target and to produce more realistic target images, we propose to use the adversarial learning strategy to better model the FCN. Moreover, the FCN is designed to incorporate an image-gradient-difference-based loss function to avoid generating blurry target images. Long-term residual unit is also explored to help the training of the network. We further apply Auto-Context Model to implement a context-aware deep convolutional adversarial network. Experimental results show that our method is accurate and robust for synthesizing target images from the corresponding source images. In particular, we evaluate our method on three datasets, to address the tasks of generating CT from MRI and generating 7T MRI from 3T MRI images. Our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods under comparison in all datasets and tasks.},

Nevertheless, existing approaches mainly focus on pre-training with simple image-text pairs, while neglecting the semantic connections between concepts from different modalities. In this paper, we propose a knowledge-based pre-training framework, dubbed Knowledge-CLIP, which injects semantic information into the widely used CLIP model. Through introducing knowledge-based objectives in the pre-training process and utilizing different types of knowledge graphs as training data, our model can semantically align the representations in vision and language with higher quality, and enhance the reasoning ability across scenarios and modalities. Extensive experiments on various vision-language downstream tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of Knowledge-CLIP compared with the original CLIP and competitive baselines.},

@article{ccgan,
   abstract = {This article focuses on conditional generative modeling (CGM) for image data with continuous, scalar conditions (termed regression labels). We propose the first model for this task which is called continuous conditional generative adversarial network (CcGAN). Existing conditional GANs (cGANs) are mainly designed for categorical conditions (e.g., class labels). Conditioning on regression labels is mathematically distinct and raises two fundamental problems: (P1) since there may be very few (even zero) real images for some regression labels, minimizing existing empirical versions of cGAN losses (a.k.a. empirical cGAN losses) often fails in practice; and (P2) since regression labels are scalar and infinitely many, conventional label input mechanisms (e.g., combining a hidden map of the generator/discriminator with a one-hot encoded label) are not applicable. We solve these problems by: (S1) reformulating existing empirical cGAN losses to be appropriate for the continuous scenario; and (S2) proposing a naive label input (NLI) mechanism and an improved label input (ILI) mechanism to incorporate regression labels into the generator and the discriminator. The reformulation in (S1) leads to two novel empirical discriminator losses, termed the hard vicinal discriminator loss (HVDL) and the soft vicinal discriminator loss (SVDL) respectively, and a novel empirical generator loss. Hence, we propose four versions of CcGAN employing different proposed losses and label input mechanisms. The error bounds of the discriminator trained with HVDL and SVDL, respectively, are derived under mild assumptions. To evaluate the performance of CcGANs, two new benchmark datasets (RC-49 and Cell-200) are created. A novel evaluation metric (Sliding Fréchet Inception Distance) is also proposed to replace Intra-FID when Intra-FID is not applicable. Our extensive experiments on several benchmark datasets (i.e., RC-49, UTKFace, Cell-200, and Steering Angle with both low and high resolutions) support the following findings: the proposed CcGAN is able to generate diverse, high-quality samples from the image distribution conditional on a given regression label; and CcGAN substantially outperforms cGAN both visually and quantitatively.},

The technique therefore has enormous potential for addressing novel research questions in both basic and clinical neuroscience. This book aims to cover the field of diffusion imaging from the fundamental theory to its most cutting-edge applications. It contains sufficient detail to be a reference book for medical physicists, but will also cover fundamental aspects of experimental design and example applications that will be of interest to clinical and basic neuroscientists. Importantly, the book presents diffusion imaging in the context of well-established, classical experimental techniques, so that readers will be able to assess the scope and limitations of the new imaging technology with respect to techniques available previously. Each section includes chapters on methodology (with the more advanced, mathematical material included in appendices for the interested reader), validation of the imaging technology, and application of diffusion imaging to the study of variation and development of normal brain anatomy, and disruption to the white matter in neurological disease or psychiatric disorder. The aim of the book is to become an essential reference text for scientists designing or interpreting diffusion MR experiments.

The benefit of tensor-valued diffusion encoding is that it unlocks the 'shape of the b-tensor' as a new encoding dimension. By modulating the b-tensor shape, we can control the sensitivity to microscopic diffusion anisotropy which can be used as a contrast mechanism; a feature that is inaccessible by conventional diffusion encoding. Since imaging methods based on tensor-valued diffusion encoding are finding an increasing number of applications we are prompted to highlight the challenge of designing the optimal gradient waveforms for any given application. In this review, we first establish the basic design objectives in creating field gradient waveforms for tensor-valued diffusion MRI. We also survey additional design considerations related to limitations imposed by hardware and physiology, potential confounding effects that cannot be captured by the b-tensor, and artifacts related to the diffusion encoding waveform. Throughout, we discuss the expected compromises and tradeoffs with an aim to establish a more complete understanding of gradient waveform design and its impact on accurate measurements and interpretations of data.},

The diffusion tensor may be used to characterize the magnitude, the degree of anisotropy, and the orientation of directional diffusion. This review addresses the biological mechanisms, acquisition, and analysis of DTI measurements. The relationships between DTI measures and white matter pathologic features (e.g., ischemia, myelination, axonal damage, inflammation, and edema) are summarized. Applications of DTI to tissue characterization in neurotherapeutic applications are reviewed. The interpretations of common DTI measures (mean diffusivity, MD; fractional anisotropy, FA; radial diffusivity, Dr; and axial diffusivity, Da) are discussed. In particular, FA is highly sensitive to microstructural changes, but not very specific to the type of changes (e.g., radial or axial). To maximize the specificity and better characterize the tissue microstructure, future studies should use multiple diffusion tensor measures (e.g., MD and FA, or Da and Dr). © 2007 The American Society for Experimental NeuroTherapeutics, Inc.},

@article{odf_dMRI,
   abstract = {We propose an integral concept for tractography to describe crossing and splitting fibre bundles based on the fibre orientation distribution function (ODF) estimated from high angular resolution diffusion imaging (HARDI). We show that in order to perform accurate probabilistic tractography, one needs to use a fibre ODF estimation and not the diffusion ODF. We use a new fibre ODF estimation obtained from a sharpening deconvolution transform (SDT) of the diffusion ODF reconstructed from q-ball imaging (QBI). This SDT provides new insight into the relationship between the HARDI signal, the diffusion ODF, and the fibre ODF. We demonstrate that the SDT agrees with classical spherical deconvolution and improves the angular resolution of QBI. Another important contribution of this paper is the development of new deterministic and new probabilistic tractography algorithms using the full multidirectional information obtained through use of the fibre ODF. An extensive comparison study is performed on human brain datasets comparing our new deterministic and probabilistic tracking algorithms in complex fibre crossing regions. Finally, as an application of our new probabilistic tracking, we quantify the reconstruction of transcallosal fibres intersecting with the corona radiata and the superior longitudinal fasciculus in a group of eight subjects. Most current diffusion tensor imaging (DTI)-based methods neglect these fibres, which might lead to incorrect interpretations of brain functions. © 2009 IEEE.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The auditory radiation crosses other white matter tracts and cannot reliably be delineated or quantitatively assessed with DTI fiber tracking. This study investigates whether HARDI fiber tracking can be used to robustly delineate the full extent of the tract. MATERIALS AND METHODS: HARDI (64-direction, b=3000 s/mm2) and DTI (30-direction, b=1000 s/mm2) were acquired from 25 control participants between 8 and 26 years old. Probabilistic HARDI and DTI fiber tracking of the auditory radiation was performed with starting and filter regions automatically generated from the FreeSurfer white matter parcellation. DTI fiber tracking was performed with both the 64-direction and the 30-direction datasets. Fiber-tracking trials demonstrating connectivity from the Heschl gyrus to the medial geniculate nucleus were considered successful. RESULTS: The HARDI fiber tracking success rate was 98% and was significantly higher than the 64-direction DTI rate of 50% or the 30-direction DTI rate of 42% (P < .001). The success rates of HARDI fiber tracking for the left and right auditory radiations were not significantly different. In contrast, the left auditory radiation was successfully delineated with DTI fiber tracking at a higher rate than the right auditory radiation. CONCLUSIONS: HARDI can discriminate the complex white matter pathways at the junction of the auditory radiation and the ILF. HARDI fiber tracking can reliably delineate the auditory radiation.},

   abstract = {Diffusion-weighted MRI (DW-MRI) has been increasingly used in imaging neuroscience over the last decade. An early form of this technique, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) was rapidly implemented by major MRI scanner companies as a scanner selling point. Due to the ease of use of such implementations, and the plausibility of some of their results, DTI was leapt on by imaging neuroscientists who saw it as a powerful and unique new tool for exploring the structural connectivity of human brain. However, DTI is a rather approximate technique, and its results have frequently been given implausible interpretations that have escaped proper critique and have appeared misleadingly in journals of high reputation. In order to encourage the use of improved DW-MRI methods, which have a better chance of characterizing the actual fiber structure of white matter, and to warn against the misuse and misinterpretation of DTI, we review the physics of DW-MRI, indicate currently preferred methodology, and explain the limits of interpretation of its results. We conclude with a list of 'Do's and Don'ts' which define good practice in this expanding area of imaging neuroscience. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.},

   abstract = {Deep learning has been successfully adopted for accelerated MRI reconstruction given its exceptional performance in inverse problems. Deep reconstruction models are commonly based on convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures that use compact input-invariant filters to capture static local features in data. While this inductive bias allows efficient model training on relatively small datasets, it also limits sensitivity to long-range context and compromises generalization performance. Transformers are a promising alternative that use broad-scale and input-adaptive filtering to improve contextual sensitivity and generalization. Yet, existing transformer architectures induce quadratic complexity and they often neglect the physical signal model. Here, we introduce a model-based transformer architecture (MoTran) for high-performance MRI reconstruction. MoTran is an adversarial architecture that unrolls transformer and data-consistency blocks in its generator. Cross-attention transformers are leveraged to maintain linear complexity in terms of the feature map size. Comprehensive experiments on MRI reconstruction tasks show that the proposed model improves the image quality over state-of-the-art CNN models.},

applications for example, it might not be clear from a CT scan alone which
particular region is cancer tissue. Therefore a group of graders typically
produces a set of diverse but plausible segmentations. We consider the task of
learning a distribution over segmentations given an input. To this end we
propose a generative segmentation model based on a combination of a U-Net with
a conditional variational autoencoder that is capable of efficiently producing
an unlimited number of plausible hypotheses. We show on a lung abnormalities
segmentation task and on a Cityscapes segmentation task that our model
reproduces the possible segmentation variants as well as the frequencies with
which they occur, doing so significantly better than published approaches.
These models could have a high impact in real-world applications, such as being
used as clinical decision-making algorithms accounting for multiple plausible
semantic segmentation hypotheses to provide possible diagnoses and recommend
further actions to resolve the present ambiguities.},

standard stochastic gradient descent (when rescaled by the learning rate), but
as we demonstrate this is \emph\{not\} the case for adaptive gradient algorithms,

   abstract = {Target audience: Researchers interested in reducing MRI acquisition time while maintaining the most relevant measurements to characterise tissue properties. Purpose: Long acquisition times hamper the translation of microstructural (diffusion) MRI to clinical applications. Various approaches have been proposed for designing optimal diffusion MRI protocols to acquire the most informative measurements in the shortest possible time, 1-3 most of them based on a priori assumed models or representations and parameter values. This work aims to develop and compare data-driven machine learning approaches that select an optimal subset of measurements from a larger set to ultimately reduce acquisition time while maintaining the maximum information content. Specifically, we compare the performance of autoencoder neural networks trained to subselect measurements and subsequently predict all the measurements with minimal error, and are either 1) agnostic to the signal model and parameters of interest, or 2) "physics-informed", i.e., including a signal model to drive the subselection. Methods: Five healthy controls were scanned on a 3T 40mT/m scanner with a 5D Diffusion-T1-T2 * protocol varying b-value (b), gradient direction (Θg, Φg), inversion time (TI) and delay time (TD) in an asymmetric spin echo 1,4 (1344 unique settings). Repetition time (TR) and b-tensor anisotropy (bΔ) were 7500 ms and 1, respectively. The data were preprocessed as previously described. 1 The selection of the most representative set of measurements was based on a concrete autoencoder, which has shown superior performance in reconstructing the full set of measurements compared to other approaches. 1,5 The autoencoder included a concrete selection layer (CL) as encoder with the size indicating the maximum number of selected measurements. 5,6 The decoder was either 1) a neural network (coined CL+NN) or 2) a physics-informed neural network with a forward signal equation (coined CL+eq): 4,7 Figure 1. Networks employed to select the optimal subset of measurements and predict back all the measurements with minimal error. The decoder in CL+eq incorporates a forward signal equation which is a function of the first eigenvector direction (Θ and Φ), parallel (D║) and perpendicular diffusivity (D┴), T2*, T1 and S0. Both networks were trained on voxels from the whole brain to select unique 500 measurements using a specific regularisation method, 8 based on leave-one-out cross-validation using the Adam optimiser with learning rate 0.001, batch size 256, and mean-squared error (MSE) loss. We investigated differences on validation data in i) the subset of selected measurements, ii) errors of predicted measurements, and iii) accuracy of parameter estimates. All experiments were conducted on synthetic data obtained from maps estimated on the full dataset using a network similar as CL+eq but without the selector layer, with added Gaussian noise (signal-to-noise ratio SNR = 30). Maps from subselected measurements identified by the CL+NN and CL+eq were estimated in a similar way and compared to the ground truth (GT). Results: Regarding the selected measurements, the lowest TI values were consistently selected across b-values for both approaches, while medium-high Tis were more frequently selected for CL+NN and b-values equal or lower than 1000 s/mm 2 for CL+eq (Fig. 2A). The reconstructed signal MSE distributions were similar for white matter and grey matter (Fig. 2B left), while when considering the selected and not-selected measurements separately, the CL+eq MSE was higher for the selected volumes and lower for the not-selected volumes (Fig. 2B right). The maps estimated from the subselected measurements presented lower error compared to the synthetic GT for the indices selected with the CL+eq approach across tissue types for parallel and perpendicular diffusivity, T2* and S0 (Fig. 2B bottom shows absolute error distributions in grey matter), although this difference was not immediately apparent in the estimated maps (Fig. 2C). Discussion & Conclusion: In this work, two data-driven subset selection strategies were compared, one based on a full data-driven method (CL+NN) and another informed by a signal equation (CL+eq). CL+eq indices yielded higher accuracy for the estimation of quantitative parameters, but estimation on CL+NN selected measurements also achieved high accuracy despite being agnostic to the parameters of interest. Notably, for both selection strategies, volumes with low SNR, i.e., high b-values and low TI values, were consistently sampled, suggesting that the optimal subset may be related to the difficulty of reconstructing those measurements. Moreover, the MSE values from the measurements selected by CL+eq and CL+NN were similar, despite the former network being substantially smaller. In summary, this work shows that data-driven protocol optimisation provides useful information on measurement redundancy and can be informed by prior knowledge on the signal equation. Future work will investigate diverse network structures, loss functions (e.g., directly minimising the parameter errors), and extension to other multi-contrast databases. Figure 2.

A problem of echo-planar images is the geometrical distortions that obtain near junctions between tissues of differing magnetic susceptibility. This results in distorted diffusion-tensor maps. To resolve this we suggest acquiring two images for each diffusion gradient; one with bottom-up and one with top-down traversal of k-space in the phase-encode direction. This achieves the simultaneous goals of providing information on the underlying displacement field and intensity maps with adequate spatial sampling density even in distorted areas. The resulting DT maps exhibit considerably higher geometric fidelity, as assessed by comparison to an image volume acquired using a conventional 3D MR technique. © 2003 Elsevier Inc.

   abstract = {In magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), the image contrast is the result of the subtle interaction between the physicochemical properties of the imaged living tissue and the parameters used for image acquisition. By varying parameters such as the echo time (TE) and the inversion time (TI), it is possible to collect images that capture different expressions of this sophisticated interaction. Sensitization to diffusion-summarized by the b-value-constitutes yet another explorable “dimension” to modify the image contrast, which reflects the degree of dispersion of water in various directions within the tissue microstructure. The full exploration of this multidimensional acquisition parameter space offers the promise of a more comprehensive description of the living tissue but at the expense of lengthy MRI acquisitions, often unfeasible in clinical practice. The harnessing of multidimensional information passes through the use of intelligent sampling strategies for reducing the amount of images to acquire, and the design of methods for exploiting the redundancy in such information. This chapter reports the results of the MUDI challenge, comparing different strategies for predicting the acquired densely sampled multidimensional data from sub-sampled versions of it.},

   abstract = {Deep MRI reconstruction is commonly performed with conditional models that de-alias undersampled acquisitions to recover images consistent with fully-sampled data. Since conditional models are trained with knowledge of the imaging operator, they can show poor generalization across variable operators. Unconditional models instead learn generative image priors decoupled from the imaging operator to improve reliability against domain shifts. Recent diffusion models are particularly promising given their high sample fidelity. Nevertheless, inference with a static image prior can perform suboptimally. Here we propose the first adaptive diffusion prior for MRI reconstruction, AdaDiff, to improve performance and reliability against domain shifts. AdaDiff leverages an efficient diffusion prior trained via adversarial mapping over large reverse diffusion steps. A two-phase reconstruction is executed following training: a rapid-diffusion phase that produces an initial reconstruction with the trained prior, and an adaptation phase that further refines the result by updating the prior to minimize reconstruction loss on acquired data. Demonstrations on multi-contrast brain MRI clearly indicate that AdaDiff outperforms competing conditional and unconditional methods under domain shifts, and achieves superior or on par within-domain performance.},

   abstract = {Deep learning has been successfully adopted for accelerated MRI reconstruction given its exceptional performance in inverse problems. Deep reconstruction models are commonly based on convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures that use compact input-invariant filters to capture static local features in data. While this inductive bias allows efficient model training on relatively small datasets, it also limits sensitivity to long-range context and compromises generalization performance. Transformers are a promising alternative that use broad-scale and input-adaptive filtering to improve contextual sensitivity and generalization. Yet, existing transformer architectures induce quadratic complexity and they often neglect the physical signal model. Here, we introduce a model-based transformer architecture (MoTran) for high-performance MRI reconstruction. MoTran is an adversarial architecture that unrolls transformer and data-consistency blocks in its generator. Cross-attention transformers are leveraged to maintain linear complexity in terms of the feature map size. Comprehensive experiments on MRI reconstruction tasks show that the proposed model improves the image quality over state-of-the-art CNN models.},

   abstract = {We propose a new plug-and-play priors (PnP) based MR image reconstruction method that systematically enforces data consistency while also exploiting deep-learning priors. Our prior is specified through a convolutional neural network (CNN) trained without any artifact-free ground truth to remove under-sampling artifacts from MR images. The results on reconstructing free-breathing MRI data into ten respiratory phases show that the method can form high-quality 4D images from severely undersampled measurements corresponding to acquisitions of about 1 and 2 minutes in length. The results also highlight the competitive performance of the method compared to several popular alternatives, including the TGV regularization and traditional UNet3D.
